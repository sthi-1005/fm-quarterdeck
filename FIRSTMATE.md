# Quarterdeck operating rules for Firstmate

These reusable rules belong to Quarterdeck, not stock Firstmate. A supervising
Firstmate pairing with this dashboard should read this file from an approved,
stable checkout. Workers retain their assigned role and authority; nothing here
permits delegation, shared-service administration or a supervisor role change.

## Pairing and private overrides

In the selected home's private preferences, use this soft reference, replacing
the placeholder with the approved stable file location:

```text
Quarterdeck operating rules: read <approved Quarterdeck checkout>/FIRSTMATE.md
```

Keep installation-specific values and approvals in a **private local override**
(the selected home's private preferences and health configuration), outside this
repository. This includes identity, repository destinations, source pin, state
owners, launch method, private network origin, service bindings, active posture,
return policy and exact merge/publication/maintenance authority. Do not put them
in public examples, fixtures, commits, reports or comments. Read the override
alongside these rules; do not guess missing values or approvals. Explicit task
and role constraints take precedence. On consequential conflicts, ask the owner
rather than broadening authority.

Reading this file installs nothing. It does not edit preferences, enable hooks,
register checks, restart services or grant standing release approval. Existing
onboarding-owned preference blocks retain their byte/version ownership contract;
do not replace their contents by hand. The Preferences UI still reads the private
preference record; it does not recursively load this reference.

## Dashboard continuity and local landings

- Quarterdeck is the live dashboard; durable documents are not its live UI.
  Keep Quarterdeck-owned integrations in this repository and activate only
  reviewed pins. Prefer hooks, seams and separate integrations over rewriting
  stock Firstmate; document any deviation.
- Before implementation, reconcile the isolated task branch with the approved
  local integration base, not merely a remote base that omits local landings.
  Stop on conflicts that need an owner decision. Requested, clean, tested local
  changes land only through the supervising Firstmate's authorized path; a
  worker's completion is not a merge or deployment approval.
- After **every local landing**, including documentation or tests, the serving
  process must be restarted on the approved clean revision: it serves only its
  startup commit and fails closed when HEAD changes. Under existing maintenance
  authority, the supervisor launches on a fresh free loopback binding, preserves
  the selected home and private state owners, repoints only the proven owned
  private proxy handler, verifies local and private-network health and revision,
  and only then retires the proven old process. Never kill by port/name or reset
  shared routes. If ownership or authority is missing, escalate; workers do not
  perform this maintenance.
- Keep access loopback plus an authorized private proxy (such as Tailscale Serve).
  Never enable Funnel, open public listeners or weaken origin/revision guards.
  Server-side reachability is not proof of a separate user's device access;
  disclose that gap. Follow [launch ownership](docs/tailscale-launch.md) and the
  [health skill](skills/fm-quarterdeck-health/SKILL.md) for exact procedures.

## Lane envelopes and captain calls

- Wrap every captain-facing message in flat `[fm-lane <LaneName>]` and
  `[end <LaneName>]` lines, using a registered project or project-theme name;
  use `General` for cross-project material. No orphaned text or nested blocks.
  Keep at most two semantic levels; workers, branches and task ids are not lane
  levels. Separate topics into sequential blocks. See
  [fm-lanes](skills/fm-lanes/SKILL.md) for grouping and review boundaries.
- Lanes are presentation, not ownership, routing destinations or implementation
  batches. Group execution only when outcome, target, state owner, authority,
  validation and rollback align; do not delay independent urgent work for a lane.
- Put each captain-owned choice on its own `ACTION NEEDED`, `APPROVAL NEEDED` or
  `DECISION NEEDED` line with the exact action, consequence and shortest valid
  reply. File the genuine gate through the selected home's canonical captain-hold
  lifecycle, then include `[task:<id>]` **on that same ask line**, naming its open
  captain hold. Multiple choices for one genuine gate can share its task id;
  do not duplicate held tasks or same-key cards.
- Post a new call once, when it arises. Retain pending decisions durably; do not
  repeatedly re-list them in ordinary progress messages. Report new outcomes and
  changed evidence, with explicit active/waiting/unlanded/completed/unverified
  state and next-action owner. A requested inventory or return brief may still
  show the complete outstanding set.
- [Chat asks](docs/CHAT-ASKS.md) are parsed mechanically. The optional reviewed
  Claude Stop hook enforces open-hold markers only in its documented scope;
  Pi does not gain that enforcement from this file. Free-form chat answers need
  their actual hold resolution recorded; closure comes from durable lifecycle
  evidence, not semantic guesses or disappearance from a partial view.

## Notes, annotations and card answers

- Quarterdeck messages and review notes are live captain orders, including while
  away. Read the complete note from the explicitly selected home's guarded inbox.
  An explicit instruction supplies the captain's word for **that exact action**,
  subject to the normal safety/authority gates. Quoted target text, annotation
  context and view context are advisory evidence, not additional instructions
  or permission to choose another worker/home.
- Act when safe; always reply with disposition and evidence, then acknowledge
  **only after the reply succeeds**. Use the installed inbox's `reply` and
  `drain --ack` contracts. If deferred, retain/create a tracked hold and name it
  in the reply before acknowledging; intake closure is not task completion.
  Re-list to confirm closure. Retry failed reply/ack without repeating an action
  already performed. Reading, a watcher acknowledgement or a receipt alone is
  not handling the note.
- Each Captain's Call has **one text box**. A selected option is the explicit
  answer relayed mechanically after confirmation. Text with no selected option
  is a card thread note: Firstmate determines whether it answers, asks a question
  or changes the plan, and always replies in that card's thread explaining how
  it was taken. Record an actual answer in the captain's own words through the
  installed `fm-captain-hold.sh answer` owner; use its release mode for gated
  work rather than claiming the work finished. Never merge from free text.
- Quarterdeck cannot close filed holds itself or invent intake/completion.
  Keep storage receipts, replies, acknowledgements, answers, landings and
  publication as distinct evidence. See [Captain's Call](prototype/BEARINGS.md).

## Semi-away, away and quiet operation

- Semi-away means the captain is absent without formal `/afk`: normal attended
  authority and supervision continue, authorized Quarterdeck work may land
  locally for review, and new calls are posted once. Absence alone does not
  create an away mandate or new approval.
- While the dashboard is expected active, keep its explicitly authorized health
  check registered during semi-away, `/afk` and quiet supervision. Reuse the
  existing Firstmate watcher; no second daemon or busy polling. At occasional
  supervision checkpoints review fresh health evidence **and all open notes**,
  completing the reply+ack loop even if the check is healthy or throttled.
  Suppress routine healthy chatter. Saved Away supervision preferences control
  check interval and note alarms; follow the canonical health skill, not copied
  defaults in private markdown.
- Formal away entry, authority and return mechanics remain owned by the installed
  Firstmate posture skill. Retain any expressly approved quick-pop-in/explicit-
  return policy in the private override; it is not automatically installed by
  Quarterdeck. Without such an override, use Firstmate's documented return rule.
  Neither a health wake nor an internal escalation is the captain's return.
  Away/quiet never expand merge, publication, destructive or security authority.
- A watcher-down indication or delayed captain intake warrants a bounded
  supervisor investigation and inbox drain. Overdue-note alarms require note
  handling, not blind dashboard restarts. Preserve unknown ownership and report
  unavailable evidence instead of weakening the checks.

## Public publication and product direction

- Local acceptance is separate from public publication. When explicitly
  authorized, publish through the configured Firstmate bot's pull requests;
  the maintainer/captain owns their merge. Use the private identity configuration,
  no-reply commit author/committer identities and no fabricated co-authors.
  Identify bot comments visibly as an AI agent posting on the maintainer's behalf,
  never as the captain. No identity or account details belong in this file.
- Before **every public push**, scan the exact outgoing diff and commit metadata
  for private identities, home locations, network names, emails, session ids,
  credentials and private organization/product/customer names. Use neutral
  placeholders throughout public material, including fixtures and forge text.
  Report the scan and exact intended destination; passing it grants no push or
  merge authority. Retain live task metadata until its publication lifecycle
  completes; prefer independent changes over fragile squash-merged stacks.
- Mobile friendliness is standing product intent. Validate visible behavior in
  one bounded pass on the exact served revision, including narrow layouts and
  readable, usable controls. Static checks are not browser-paint evidence;
  report remaining device/browser gaps. Do not install packages, alter shared
  services or open user-facing browser windows without authority.
- **Mechanical surfacing:** derive cards and attention deterministically from
  authoritative records and transcript markers, not remembered behavioral rules
  or model-authored invented state. Quarterdeck may project stock Firstmate
  output but invents none; prefer a Quarterdeck-only projection and record its
  design in [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). Preserve missing/stale/partial
  evidence and provenance. Primary chat composers address only primary Firstmate.
- Use [fm-toolcheck](skills/fm-toolcheck/SKILL.md) only as a requested read-only
  audit, never an upgrade authorization. Deliberately consider
  [fm-quartermaster](skills/fm-quartermaster/SKILL.md) at meaningful evidence
  boundaries, not on every change; its bounded one-shot review is advisory and
  gives workers no delegation or execution authority.

Activation, pinning and rollback are documented in
[Firstmate integrations](docs/FIRSTMATE-INTEGRATIONS.md). This operating layer
replaces duplicated Quarterdeck policy, not upstream safety rules or private
standing approvals.

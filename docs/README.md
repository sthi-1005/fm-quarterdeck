# Quarterdeck documentation

Quarterdeck is the Firstmate operational cockpit: conversations are the shell; lanes are the workspace. The custom frontend in `prototype/` is the product runtime.

## Source map

- `prototype/`: Node built-in server/adapters, `public/` browser UI, synthetic `test/` and optional `scripts/` checks.
- `expenses/`: empty valid public ledger, Python helper and synthetic tests; real records belong in the selected-home overlay.
- `skills/`: optional Quarterdeck-owned integration instructions/tools.
- `prototype/TRANSCRIPTS.md`, `SESSION-WINDOW.md`, `WORK-TAXONOMY.md`, `LAYOUT-CORRECTION.md`, `VISUAL-DESIGN.md`: detailed ingestion, work and presentation contracts.

Normal record readers are read-only. Narrow guarded review/intake, taxonomy and preview-selection operations are explicit exceptions, not arbitrary operational control. A local candidate, receipt, running process, remote checkpoint and deployed release are different evidence states.

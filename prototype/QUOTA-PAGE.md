# Subscription limits page

The Quota page presents sanitized, read-only source evidence. It does not refresh credentials, rank subscriptions by spend priority, or estimate consumption.

- **At a glance:** Tightest / Most room use valid effective scope percentages from fresh providers only, with stable ties and visible unknown counts. Runway tallies source scope statuses. Next reset excludes past timestamps and individually stale/non-fresh providers. A failed whole refresh retains explicitly labelled **captured** upcoming reset evidence, but never effective availability, pace or runway.
- **Provider cards:** the headline is the lowest known effective scope percentage. Every reported window appears once as a remaining-capacity meter; the notch is source-capture time remaining, not consumption. LIMIT tags require source `limitingWindowIds`. A band requires both a valid notch and a source pace reserve; its geometry pictures the fill/notch positions, while its text retains the source reserve even if the numbers differ. Label-derived durations alone never establish pace.
- **Details:** native disclosures start collapsed, retaining exact resets, scopes and bounds, runway durations/exhaustion timestamps, annotations and pacing explanations. The all-details toggle does not persist across reloads. Age ticks preserve native open state, focus and selection.
- **Ordering:** page and sidebar share `fm-agentos-sidebar-quota-sort.v1` (`highest`, `lowest`, `runway`, `runway-lowest`, `az`, `za`) and update together. Both controls offer one key each — Left, Runway, AZ — and selecting the active key reverses its direction; returning to another key retains that key's direction for this page session. Provider keys use the worst family key, with unknown/stale last. This intentionally replaces the old page-only effective-scope ordering with the sidebar's window-based ordering. Family/window source order is retained inside each card.
- **Missing providers:** the chip tray orders errors before connected-without-limits and sign-in/unavailable states. Hide not set up hides only this tray. Unsupported entry counts stay visible separately. No server allowlist fields or persisted namespaces changed.

The compact sidebar cards and phone sheet retain their previous renderer and visual rules. Page-only presentation is scoped to `.quota-family-page` and `#quota-view`.

## Offline validation

```sh
cd prototype
node --test test/quota*test.js test/ui.test.js
node scripts/quota-browser-pass.mjs
node scripts/quota-horizons-browser-pass.mjs
node scripts/sidebar-quota-browser-pass.mjs
# Required absolute destination outside the repository:
QUOTA_CAPTURE_DIR=/absolute/private/captures node scripts/quota-page-screenshots.mjs
```

Browser scripts require a clean committed revision and Chromium (`CHROMIUM` or PATH). The screenshot matrix uses sanitized synthetic fixtures and a fixed source clock: 1440×1000, 834×1000, 390×844 and 320×700, normal Left ↑, Runway sort, provider stale, whole stale, unavailable, loading, expanded, forced colours and exhaustion. It checks overflow/card clipping before capturing. Do not commit runtime screenshots or live readings.

`quota-acceptance-fixture.mjs` can also serve these states on consecutive loopback ports, starting at `QUOTA_ACCEPT_PORT` (default 4187). No live quota or account CLI is invoked.

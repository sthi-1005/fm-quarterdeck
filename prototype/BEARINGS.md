# Live Captain's Call

Overview shows the calls Firstmate is holding for the captain and updates them in place as Firstmate decides, without a page reload or a `/bearings` run. A card can be answered in place; the answer is relayed to Firstmate only after the captain reviews and confirms it, and Firstmate alone resolves filed holds. Chat-only asks have the mechanical Quarterdeck resolution paths below.

Code: `bearings.js` (server), `bearings-answer.js` (answer relay), `public/bearings-live.js` (transport), `public/bearings-patch.js` (keyed patcher and engagement hold), `public/bearings-answer-form.js` (answer phases), `public/call-lifecycle.js` (one lifecycle state per card), `public/bearings-overflow.js` (retained; cards no longer clamp) and `public/bearings-dismiss.js` (chat dismissal phases). Product rendering (`public/bearings-view.js`) supplies `cardHtml`, `emptyHtml`, `coverageText`, `heldText` and `stubHtml`; the patcher has a minimal fallback for each.

## Source and authority

- Filed calls come from exactly one Firstmate interface: `$FM_HOME/bin/fm-bearings-snapshot.sh --json` (never `--include-prs`), with `FM_HOME` set, nice 10, a 45 s process-group kill, 2 MiB stdout and 4 KiB stderr caps. Concurrent callers share one run.
- It never creates calls from backlog, meta or status records, and writes nothing under `FM_HOME`. After the snapshot, a read-only, 2 MiB bounded read of the selected home's `data/backlog.md` supplements only existing `(main)` decisions by exact task id: durable clocks, a missing hold reason, and the backlog `(repo:)` name when the snapshot has no repository for that call. The same read supplements `(main)` landed rows with `(repo:)` and the newest `(done|merged|reported YYYY-MM-DD)`. A repository path is reduced to its final segment. Reasons come only from the versioned `fm-hold-v1` base64 field on unchecked captain holds (16 KiB decoded cap), never body prose; duplicate ids, malformed encodings and invalid UTF-8 are rejected. Source reasons win on the stored `reason` field. No other home's records are inspected. The snapshot's own documented observational cache refresh is the only fleet-side write, the same as a plain `/bearings`.
- Each snapshot run may also read the selected home's `.lavish/bearings-board.html` when that path is a regular file of at most 1 MiB. The read is UTF-8 text. Quarterdeck takes the JSON inside `<script id="bearings-data" type="application/json">` and checks `schema` `fm-bearings-board.v1`, a non-empty `home`, a timestamp `generated`, and an array `captains_call`. A raw `<` in that block is rejected, matching the builder's `\u003c` escape, so the block cannot be closed early. The page is never executed. A missing file, symlink, oversized file, bad encoding, or failed check leaves options on the snapshot path below. How a fresh card becomes choices is owned by Answers.
- Validation fails closed: `schema` must be `fm-bearings.v1`, and `decisions_open`, `omitted` and `contributions` (`captain[]`, `known`, `checked`, `proven_clear`) must have the expected types. A missing home or script, a failed run or invalid output never synthesizes calls: with a previous good model it stays visible as `state: "stale"`; without one the model is `state: "unavailable"` with no cards.

## Model `fm-quarterdeck-call.v1`

`GET /api/bearings` returns:

```
{ schema, rev, state, observedAt, checkedAt, generatedAt, stale, error, cards[], coverage, omitted[], landed[], underway[], charted[], workCoverage }
```

- `state`: `loading` (no run yet), `ready`, `stale` (last good calls; `error` says why the latest run failed) or `unavailable`.
- `observedAt`: when these calls were last produced. `checkedAt`: the latest run attempt. `generatedAt`: the snapshot clock.
- `cards[]`, in snapshot order:
  - `decision:<task>` for each `decisions_open` row: `{key, type:"decision", task, verb, summary, title?, reason?, url, owner, repo, answer, rev}`. Optional title/reason retain source evidence for chat-ask linking; a missing main-home reason may be supplemented from the guarded ledger field above. Credentials appear only as decisions.
  - `merge:<task>` for each `contributions.captain` row without a live decision or a structured contribution `hold`. A current selected-home captain hold also excludes a `(main)` Merge by exact task id, including deferred holds omitted from `decisions_open`; other owners never use that home's ledger. Current hold metadata uses the existing `parseBacklogTask` contract, never prose. The producer already excludes unheld draft, closed and merged PR observations from its captain rows; no remote polling or invented PR-state fields are added. Eligible released rows return on the next good snapshot. Merge cards contain: `{key, type:"merge", task, kind, url, reason, owner, repo, checkedAt, answer, rev}`. `url` is `https:` only, otherwise `null`.
  - `landed:<task>` for each snapshot `landed` row: `{key, type:"landed", task, what, repo, owner, url, artifact, clock, rev}`. See Just landed.
  - `answer` is `null` (answer in chat) or `{question, options[{value,label,hint}], recommend, close, freeform:true}`; see Answers.
  - `rev` is a 16-hex sha256 of the card's canonical JSON; an unchanged card keeps its `rev`.
- `coverage`: `{known, checked, complete, provenClear, captainOmitted, unmeasuredHomes}`. Say "Nothing needs your action right now" only when `provenClear`; otherwise "No decision is recorded · checked X of Y".
- `omitted[]`: `{kind:"deferred-holds", count}` (blocked, dated or aged holds not shown), `{kind:"decisions-bound", shown, total}`, `{kind:"invalid-rows", count}`, and `{kind:"invalid-landed", count}` when a landed row is dropped.
- Model `rev` hashes `cards`, `coverage`, `omitted`, and `landed` when any landed card is present. It never hashes the snapshot clock, so an unchanged Captain's Call is never pushed again. An empty landed list leaves the hash unchanged.
- Privacy: `repo` is a basename, report and checkout paths are never served, and absolute paths inside free text are reduced to `…/<last segment>`.

Sections are pluggable (`SECTIONS` in `bearings.js`). The served model enables `call`, `landed`, `underway` and `charted` on the same snapshot and transport.

## Card clocks and sorting

Each card has `clock:{label,at}`. Decision clocks use the newest durable `updated_at`, `hold_set_at` or `created` source field. The selected-home ledger supplements `(since YYYY-MM-DD)` creation dates and a leading `Captain hold set:` stamp when the snapshot omits them. Merge clocks use contribution `checked_at`. Missing evidence shows **unknown**, never file mtimes, snapshot time or first-seen time. Date-only creation evidence retains its date and says **time unknown** rather than inventing midnight. Full timestamps display absolute local time and a ticking relative age; ticks change only clock text and pause during text selection.

**Sort calls** offers Newest first (default) and Oldest first on desktop and phone. It sorts by this durable clock, with stable source-order ties and unknowns last in either direction. The viewer's choice persists in `localStorage` under `fm-quarterdeck-call-sort.v1` (memory fallback on storage failure). Reordering uses the same engagement hold and release grace as snapshot updates, including a sort-pending notice and Update now beside the sort control (never a page notice). Existing form nodes, drafts and confirmation phases survive sorting.

## Cadence

- Runs happen only while someone watches: an open stream, or a `GET /api/bearings` within the last 60 s. With nobody watching there are no watchers, timers or runs.
- While watched, a run is requested by: `fs.watch` of `data/backlog.md` and `state/*.meta` (non-recursive, so the snapshot's cache subdirectory never triggers); a 10 s mtime/size fingerprint of the same names as a backstop; the age ceiling; and the first watcher when the cache is older than 60 s.
- Requests are debounced 2 s. Run starts are at least `FM_BEARINGS_MIN_GAP_MS` apart (default 30000, floor 15000). `FM_BEARINGS_MAX_AGE_MS` (default 300000, floor 60000) bounds model age while watched. One run at a time; a request during a run queues one follow-up.

## Transport

- `GET /api/bearings?since=<rev>` returns `{unchanged:true, rev, state, observedAt, checkedAt, stale, error}` when `rev` still matches, else the full model. Reads come from cache and never wait for a run. Previews proxy it.
- `GET /api/bearings/stream` (host only; 404 through a preview path; 503 beyond 16 streams per process): `text/event-stream`, `no-store`, `x-accel-buffering: no`, never gzipped.
  - On connect: `retry: 3000`, `event: hello {servedCommit}`, then `event: model` with `id: <rev>` unless `Last-Event-ID` already equals the current `rev`, in which case `event: observed`.
  - `event: model` (with `id`) when the calls change; `event: observed` with freshness fields after a run that changed nothing.
  - A `: hb` comment every 20 s. Each heartbeat and push first re-checks the served revision; on a mismatch the stream sends `event: revision` and ends.
  - Streams are recycled after 10 min with `event: bye`; `server.close()` ends open streams with `bye` and stops the scheduler.
- The client keeps one `EventSource` per visible tab and closes it on `hidden` and `pagehide`. Becoming visible fetches `?since` first, then reopens. On a stream error it runs the review config recheck, polls `?since` every 15 s, and retries the stream after 3 s, 10 s, then 30 s. `bye` reconnects at once. A `hello` whose served commit differs from the page's boot revision shows the existing "Quarterdeck updated" notice and rebinds this document's live transport to that commit. A server `revision` event shows the same notice, marks Captain's Call freshness updating, and retries with the same backoff until a hello restores the feed. Reload stays available and is not automatic. The server still closes a stream whose checkout no longer matches its boot commit.
- A refused `EventSource` construction uses the same bounded retry and HTTP polling fallback as an asynchronous stream error, rather than abandoning live updates.
- Late HTTP responses and queued events from closed streams cannot overwrite a newer read or pushed model. Suspension invalidates pending reads and reconnect continuations, including `pagehide` while the document still reports visible; a stopped controller cannot reopen from an earlier lifecycle.

## Engagement hold

The captain is engaged with a Captain's Call card while any of these hold:

- focus is inside that card (a window blur keeps focus there, so switching apps does not count as finishing);
- a non-collapsed text selection intersects that card (a selection across cards holds each intersected card);
- a pointer is pressed inside that card;
- a card is selected: a click on a card body (not a control) sets `aria-current="true"` until Escape, a second click on it, or a click outside the section.

While engaged, only that card's incoming update or removal waits. All other cards update, appear or disappear immediately. The newest model waits as `pending` only for held changes; later updates replace it. Each held card with a pending change gets `data-held="true"`, `aria-busy="true"` and a small `role="status"` notice inside it: "Call updated — updates when you're done" or "Call resolved — updates when you're done", with its own **Update now**. The card stays at full strength: there is no outdated overlay and no dimmed styling. That button applies only that card's waiting change. There is no section- or page-wide card-change notice. Cards are never `inert`, disabled or `pointer-events:none`: text stays selectable and copyable and fields stay editable. Freshness (`observed`) may refresh the empty state and coverage line, which hold no input. The separate page-level "Quarterdeck updated" notice for a new served revision is unchanged.

After a card's signals clear, its own 600 ms grace period (so moving between two fields of one card never flickers) precedes one rebuild, even if another card remains engaged:

- an unchanged card `rev` leaves the node untouched; a changed card replaces only its inner content; a new card is inserted with a one-time `call-card-new` highlight; order changes move existing nodes; a gone card fades out (`call-card-leaving`, removed after 320 ms or at once under reduced motion);
- a gone card with typed text becomes a `call-card-resolved` stub ("Resolved by Firstmate — your unsent text") with **Copy** and **Dismiss**, so no typed text is lost;
- the engaged visible card keeps its viewport position when neighbours are inserted or removed; engaged nodes are never detached to reorder them. Sort-control changes wait during engagement. Otherwise, once the list has scrolled, the first visible card stays at the same viewport position.

Drafts: every `input` on a `[data-call-draft="<field>"]` inside a card is kept per card key in memory and in `sessionStorage` under `fm-quarterdeck-call-draft.v1:<card key>`; every render restores it. Storage failures are ignored.

## Rendering hooks

Card markup from the view must carry nothing the patcher owns. The patcher creates `<article class="call-card" data-call-key data-call-rev data-call-type>` and fills it with `view.cardHtml(card)`, which must escape all card text. Typed fields use `data-call-draft="<field>"`. The empty state lives in `[data-call-empty]` inside the list; the stub's text holder is `[data-call-stub-text]` (filled with `textContent`), its buttons `[data-call-stub-copy]` and `[data-call-stub-dismiss]`.

## Rich cards and upstream data gap

Cards follow the bearings poster on Quarterdeck's light canvas: a 2px forest-ink border, a 3px hard shadow, and an enamel type chip (accent for a decision, an amber mix for a merge, a dashed surface chip for a chat ask).
The repository, when known, sits beside the chip and wraps, and the clock takes its own line.
A decision card's title is the filed hold's full reason when Quarterdeck has one: the backlog hold reason, otherwise the snapshot reason. It is never the linked chat line. With no recorded reason, the title stays the complete decision ask. A merge title is the merge reason.
An **About** row carries repository, owner, and contribution kind when present. When the snapshot has no repository, the backlog `(repo:)` field supplies the name.
Free text remains path-redacted and is never shortened by Quarterdeck: the server serves all of it, and the card shows every character it received (see Long text).
A decision retains a safe HTTPS link from a contribution with the exact same task, while still suppressing that duplicate merge card.
All displayed links come from snapshot contribution rows; no URL is guessed.
Chat asks keep a double left border at the same 2px width as other cards, so the mark does not narrow the card. Their title is the ask text.
**Also asked in chat** is its own stacked row, so that label does not widen the context column or indent the card.

The snapshot still does not provide structured `title`, `about`, `decide`, or merge `risk`. Quarterdeck does not invent those, infer checks-green from contribution kind, or rate risk. Merge cards explicitly say risk is not provided. Decision `options` and `recommend_value` may come from the selected home's board payload, as Answers describes, and otherwise from the snapshot row when that row carries them. A recorded hold reason is the decision title, including guarded main-home reason supplementation for legacy snapshots. With no recorded reason, the full source ask is the title. The About row is source metadata, not an invented work description.

Proposed upstream snapshot fields: a source-authored short `title`, descriptive `about`, explicit and unshortened `decide`, `options[{value,label,hint}]`, `recommend_value` referencing an option, a card-declared `close`, and merge `risk`, with the source contribution URL retained for both decision and merge subjects. Quarterdeck already consumes `options`, `recommend_value` and `close` on `decisions_open` rows when present (see Answers). Reading the board file does not run the board builder, and it does not inspect any other home. The selected-home ledger supplements only already-authorized decision rows as described above. Rich rendering leaves engagement hold and draft protection unchanged.

## Long text

The card title is the filed hold's full reason when one is recorded, and otherwise the full decision ask or merge reason.
There is no line clamp and no **More details** control.
Titles, options, links and task ids wrap, on desktop and on a phone, so an ellipsis never hides text that cannot be read.
The task id is always visible (`Task` and the id).
When Firstmate's snapshot itself shortened the text, it ends in `…` or `...` (decision summaries are cut at about 90 characters upstream).
Quarterdeck shows everything it received.
It never invents the missing words and never reconstructs an ask from backlog prose.
For a `(main)` decision, the selected home's unchecked backlog title and versioned captain-hold reason are read-only supplements.
The title is the item text before colon metadata (`repo`, `hold`, `hold-kind`, and the other work-view fields) and before a space-separated `(since YYYY-MM-DD)`, `(done YYYY-MM-DD)`, `(reported YYYY-MM-DD)`, or `(merged YYYY-MM-DD)` date.
A longer recorded string replaces the shortened headline only when, after whitespace is collapsed, it starts with that headline minus the trailing ellipsis.
The longest such continuation wins.
The snapshot `summary` stays the card's identity field.
When a backlog hold reason or a snapshot reason is recorded, that full reason is the decision title, even when the summary does not continue into it. The linked chat line never becomes the title. It stays in the secondary Also asked in chat row, with any `[task:...]` marker omitted. Suggested replies from that ask are option choices under the reason.
An existing main-home hold's reason still fills a missing `reason`, and a source `reason` wins when the snapshot already has one.
`backlogTitle` and `backlogReason` are kept either way so a shortened snapshot field can be compared with them.
If the headline is still shortened, it is a button (`[data-call-text-toggle]`) that opens the other recorded strings for that card: backlog title, hold reason, recorded title, recorded reason, and recorded ask.
When none of those differ, the panel says this is the full text Quarterdeck received.
That open or closed choice is memory for the tab only.
The card still says, beside the task id, that the snapshot shortened the text and names that id.
Just landed uses this same rule for its snapshot `what` and the checked item's backlog title.
A shortened landing artifact that begins with `https://` is replaced only by the longest backlog `https` URL that continues that prefix.
A landing can disclose its title and its artifact separately, and each open or closed choice is remembered on its own.
A shortened landing says the snapshot shortened it, and the task id stays on the card.
`public/bearings-overflow.js` stays loaded and does nothing while no `[data-call-more]` control is present.

## Answers

Quarterdeck relays the captain's explicit answer; it adds no authority. The answer is the same `fm-bearings-answer.v1` context the `/bearings` lavish board queues, so Firstmate routes it exactly like a board answer (bearings skill, "Handling a board wake") into `fm-captain-hold.sh`'s one keyed-answer intake, and the merge-click ruling for merges. Quarterdeck never runs `fm-captain-hold.sh`, `fm-pr-merge.sh` or any GitHub mutation, never answers by itself, and never closes a filed hold: a snapshot card leaves only when a later snapshot drops it. Chat-only cards close by the rules in Chat asks below.

**What can be answered** (`card.answer`, built by `bearings.js`):

- `question` is the board's intake key: the task id for a decision, `merge.<task>` for a merge ask. A key that fails the intake's slug shape (`[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,128}`) gives `answer: null`, and the card keeps "Answer in chat" plus a private note-to-self.
- Decision `options` and `recommend` come from a fresh matching board card when one exists, and otherwise from optional snapshot fields `options[{value,label,hint}]` and `recommend_value`. `close` (`done`|`release`) comes only from the snapshot row. The board card is the `captains_call` item whose `key` equals the decision task id. A `decision` item wins over a `credential` item with the same key. Merge-type board cards are ignored. The reserved `reconcile` choice is dropped before validation and is never offered. The board is skipped for that hold when `generated` is before the hold's latest durable update (`updated_at`, `hold_set_at`, or `created`, newest first). A date-only update is UTC midnight. One invalid remaining option (bad slug, duplicate, missing label, more than 8) voids the board set, and the snapshot row is used instead. A decision with no fresh board card and no snapshot options stays freeform, except for the lettered lines below. Snapshot `reconcile` still voids that row's own options. `recommend` must name an option that remains.
- A decision with no snapshot `options` array can take explicit lettered lines from its recorded reason, summary, or title.
  A linked decision ask supplies those lines only when the filed card still has no options, and the longest linked set wins.
  When two recorded fields offer the same number of letters, a backlog reason wins, then reason, summary, title, and backlog title.
  A line is an option only when its marker is one letter: `a)`, `(a)`, `a:`, `a -`, `Option A:`, a quoted `"a":`, or a lowercase `a.`.
  A capital `A.` sentence is not an option.
  Fewer than two lines, more than eight, or a repeated letter in any case leaves the decision freeform.
  The letter is the radio label and the selection sent on the existing answer path.
  The rest of the line is the description under that radio.
  Text with no letter selected stays a thread note.
  Merge cards do not gain these lines.
  A present snapshot `options` array, even when invalid, does not fall through to lettered lines.
  Board and snapshot options still win.
- A merge ask offers the board's single **Merge now** option (`merge`), never a recommendation.
  Only an exact, note-free `merge` is a merge order.
  A selected Merge now with a typed note is relayed with empty `selection` and `note:"merge - <typed note>"`, so keyed intake reads instruction text.
  The answer endpoint still treats a note-only body as instruction text.
  The card does not send that body: text with no option selected is a thread note.

**Captain flow** (`public/bearings-answer-form.js`; state per card key in memory and `sessionStorage` under `fm-quarterdeck-call-answer.v1:<key>`):

1. *compose*: one text box (`data-call-draft="answer"`, one line that grows) with Queue, Send and Edit beside it.
   The hint under the box is exactly "Pick an option to answer, or just type - Firstmate replies in the thread."
   Options stay real radio buttons (`data-call-draft="selection"`), one group per card (`name="call-selection-<card id>"`), so arrow keys move within a card and screen readers announce the group.
   The recommended option carries a visible **Recommended** chip that its radio names through `aria-describedby`.
   Options are compact radio rows on desktop and on a phone.
   A checked option, with or without text, is an answer through the existing relay: the option value plus the typed text as the note.
   A filed card with linked chat asks also offers their suggested replies as radios (`data-call-reply`).
   A checked reply is an answer relayed as the captain's own words (`selection:""`, `note:"<reply>[ - <note>]"`), never as a keyed option value.
   Text with no option selected, including a freeform card, is a card thread note (`fm-quarterdeck-thread`), and Firstmate replies in the thread.
   A card with `answer: null` keeps the private note-to-self and uses the same box for a thread note only.
   The box and the selected option are drafts, restored on every refill.
2. **Queue** checks locally that the box or an option is non-empty.
   An answer's `selection - note` is at most 512 UTF-8 bytes, the board's cap.
   A thread note is at most 2000 UTF-8 bytes.
   Queue moves to *confirm*: the radios disable and the text box turns read-only (still focusable and selectable), and the exact text to be sent is shown as "Queued for Firstmate".
   Nothing has been sent.
   The confirm copy names an answer or a thread note to match the path.
   The queued item also joins the review panel's queue (see "Queue integration" below), so several can go together.
3. **Send** (this card) or **Send** (the review queue) moves to *sending*, then:
   - A thread note uses `POST /api/bearings/thread` with exactly `{requestId, key, text}`.
     `202` clears the draft and returns to *compose*.
     It does not use the answer phase *sent*.
     The receipt is the history entry reloaded immediately, and the card's lifecycle becomes Sent while that note is still pending or only acknowledged (see Lifecycle).
   - An answer uses `POST /api/bearings/answer` with `{requestId, key, cardRev, selection, note}`.
     `202` → *sent*: answer drafts are cleared (so a resolved card shows no "unsent text" stub) and a receipt line follows Firstmate's inbox receipts: waiting → received → replied (polled every 15 s while visible and not yet replied).
     A reply leaves *sent* for *compose*, unlocks the controls, and the card returns to Active with that reply at the top.
   - unconfirmed (network error or `5xx`) → *failed*: **Retry send** is another explicit click and reuses the same request id, so Firstmate records one note.
     Reloading during *sending* also restores this uncertain retry state; it never resends automatically.
   - refused (`4xx`) → *refused*: the server's reason is shown and the fields unlock.
     Once a send was attempted, editing and re-queueing preserve its request id, even after a changed-card refusal or reload.
     A different payload under a recorded id is refused rather than creating a second note.
4. **Edit** returns from *confirm*/*failed* to *compose* (and takes the item out of the queue).
   An unconfirmed send warns that it may already have reached Firstmate; retry uses the original identity, and editing cannot replace a recorded note.
   **Answer again** leaves *sent* for a correction (Firstmate's intake rejects a drifted answer to a closed call).

Queue, Send and Edit sit beside the one text box on desktop and on a phone, in the same row as that box.
Only the buttons for the current phase are shown (Queue in *compose*; Send and Edit in *confirm*/*failed*).

**Queue integration.** `app.js` registers `window.quarterdeckCallQueue` (`list`, `send`, `remove`) over the answer controller's `queued()`, `sendQueued()` and `unqueue(key)`.
The review panel (`review-client.js`) lists queued items above its queued notes (desktop) or as a "Queued Captain's Call answers" batch (phone), counts them in its queued badge, and offers **Remove**, which returns the item to its card for editing (keeping its request id once a send was attempted).
**Send** and Ctrl+Enter send queued items first, each with its own request id: an answer through `POST /api/bearings/answer` and a thread note through `POST /api/bearings/thread`, then the review notes through review delivery.
On the Active status view, **Send queued (N)** calls that same `sendCallAnswers` sender when N staged items exist.
It stays hidden on every other status and when N is 0, and it is disabled while a send is in flight.
A second activation, including a concurrent **Send**, does not deliver those items again.
A card that was Queued only because of that staged item becomes Sent after the item is accepted.
Batching changes no intake, and review delivery being unavailable does not block the items.
A queued item survives reload in its *confirm* state; only an explicit click sends it.

Typing protection is unchanged: the form lives inside its held card, so focus, typing, a selection or a press holds that card's updates. If the card's `rev` changes while its answer is in *confirm* or *failed*, the next render moves it to *refused* ("changed while you were reviewing") and the captain queues it again; the server refuses a stale `cardRev` too. Answer state for calls that leave the model is forgotten on the next applied update, so a re-held task starts fresh.

**`POST /api/bearings/answer`** (host only; 404 through a preview path):

- Same-origin `authorized()` request (403), `application/json` with no query (415), body at most 4 KiB (413), and a served revision still equal to the process commit (409 `revision`).
- Body exactly `{requestId, key, cardRev, selection, note}`: `requestId` a lowercase UUID, `cardRev` the 16-hex card rev shown. The note keeps the captain's words (line endings normalised, other control characters refused).
- Refusals, each with `{error, code}` and no Firstmate call: `reconcile` selection (422, never an answer), empty (422), over 512 bytes (422), model not `ready` (409 `not-current`), key not open (409 `gone`), `cardRev` differs (409 `changed`), `answer: null` (409 `not-answerable`), selection not among the card's options (422 `bad-option`), request id reused for a different answer (409), no `FM_HOME` (503).
- Delivery: `$FM_HOME/bin/fm-inbox.sh note --request-id quarterdeck-call:<requestId> --json -` (repairing a missing wake with `announce`), the same guarded, idempotent path review notes use. `202 {state:"accepted", requestId, key, noteId, replay, sentAt, envelope}`; an unconfirmed note is `502 unconfirmed`. The process remembers the last 200 attempted request ids before delivery (including unconfirmed acknowledgements), so a retry resends the identical note even after the card has left.

The note body is one human line, a routing line, and the envelope in a ```` ```json fm-bearings-answer ```` fence (backticks inside JSON strings are escaped, so captain text cannot close it):

```
{ schema:"fm-bearings-answer.v1", question, selection, note, close?,          // the board context
  channel:"quarterdeck", type, task, label, cardRev, observedRev }           // provenance
```

Firstmate's lavish adapter rule maps it to one keyed line: `<question>\t<selection or, when empty, note>\t<label>[\t<close>]`; it ignores the provenance fields.

**`GET /api/bearings/answer/status?ids=<uuid>,…`** (host only, at most 20 ids): `{answers:{<uuid>:{state:"accepted"|"received"|"replied"|"unknown", reply?}}}` from `fm-inbox.sh receipts`; `502` when receipts are unavailable.

**Firstmate follow-up (separate repository, not done here):** the bearings skill must route an inbox note carrying a `json fm-bearings-answer` block with `channel:"quarterdeck"` exactly like a board answer — feed `<question>\t<answer>\t<label>[\t<close>]` to `fm-captain-hold.sh answers`, handle `merge.<task>` through the merge-click ruling, and record "later" as `hold --until`. Until then Firstmate reads the note as an ordinary captain note.

## Lifecycle

Every open card has exactly one lifecycle state, derived by `public/call-lifecycle.js` from data the page already holds.
Nothing new is stored as a card status.
The order is fixed: Procrastinated, then Sent, then Queued, then Active.
**Active:** the call is waiting on the captain, including after Firstmate has replied while the call stays open, and that reply is shown at the top with the controls unlocked and the thread kept.
**Queued:** the one-box item is staged locally (*confirm*, *sending*, or *failed*) and Firstmate has not accepted it.
**Sent:** an accepted captain note is still with Firstmate: a pending note reads Sent - waiting for Firstmate to read, and an acknowledged note with no reply reads Firstmate is on it.
**Procrastinated:** an unexpired Quarterdeck procrastination is in force, and it wins until the time passes or the captain brings the card back.
A refused or empty compose box is not Queued.
A Firstmate question, chat line, or reply is not Sent by itself.
Failed and in-flight sends stay Queued until accepted.
The dot stays one colour per state: Active green, Queued amber, Sent blue, Procrastinated muted.
Both Sent labels use that same blue dot.
The dot's accessible name is the state name, and the status word lives on the toggle.
A Sent card shows its receipt label, a muted card body, and a subtle diagonal hatch.
Card text stays readable and selectable, and the thread control stays usable.
A sent answer keeps its radios and note on the card: the radios are disabled, and the note is read-only so it can still be selected.
A sent answer also shows **Your answer** under that label and above the ask.
The block lists the chosen option's label, that option's value hint when the card still shows one (otherwise the sent value when it differs from the label), the typed note, and the local time it was sent.
It is filled from the sending tab's sent-answer state (`selection`, `selectionLabel`, `note`, `sentAt`) and the option hint already on the card.
A card that is Sent only because of a thread note does not show it.
On a sent answer, each option row and any select uses the same muted diagonal hatch as the card.
The chosen radio keeps an accent bar, and a select keeps its selected text.
Queued review does not use that hatch.
Queue stays hidden while the answer is Sent, and **Answer again** returns that box to compose before a reply.
A reply returns that answer to compose on its own: the radios and the note unlock, Your answer hides, and the reply banner replaces the Sent label.
A thread note that marked the card Sent leaves the box in compose for a follow-up; the hatch and label still show until Firstmate replies.
A dashed border marks the Sent dot and a dotted border marks the Procrastinated dot, so the colour is not the only signal.

The status control above the cards is one group: **Active**, **Queued**, **Sent**, **Procrastinated**, and **All**, each with its count.
Beside it, **Send queued (N)** is shown only while Active is selected and N staged items exist.
Queue integration owns that sender.
It shows Active on the first load.
The choice is remembered per viewer in `localStorage` under `fm-quarterdeck-call-lifecycle.v1`.
An unknown stored value falls back to Active.
All shows every open card in the current sort, with the dot distinguishing them.
There is no separate answered or procrastinated group heading.
Card nodes, threads, drafts, and correction controls stay in place when a filter hides them.
If hiding the card would strand focus, focus moves to that state's button.
The Overview count badge counts Active cards, the ones waiting on the captain.

`answered-calls.js` still classifies open cards from the existing inbox's pending and handled notes.
An answer note matches its validated `fm-bearings-answer.v1` envelope (schema, channel, type and exact question/intake key).
A thread note matches the card key.
The latest of those notes sets `sentReceipt`: pending while the note is still pending, acknowledged once it is handled and has no reply, and replied when a reply is present.
The selected home's receipts are read at most once per 15 seconds while the call source refreshes; a failed read retains previous evidence.
The sending tab also uses its accepted answer state immediately, including across reload.
The latest captain note decides the posture the card shows: thread history (`kind` `ask` or `answer`, `from` `captain`, `state` waiting, received, or replied), the sending tab's answer receipt, or `sentReceipt` before that history loads.
A pending note stays Sent until Firstmate acknowledges it.
An acknowledged note with no reply stays Sent.
A reply, while the call is still open, returns the card to Active.
A presentation revision change does not confirm the call or make a sent answer unsent.
Reply or receipt intake status is not confirmation: Firstmate confirms by removing the call from bearings.
Gone calls disappear from every filter; the existing unsent-text stub protection still applies.
Chat-only cards retain their existing accepted-answer resolution behavior.

## Procrastinated calls

**Procrastinate** sits in the card header's top-right, beside the repository name, and beside **Review dismissal** on a chat ask so the two read as a pair.
It is a compact pill with the type badge's height, radius and weight, and it opens a menu of 3 hours, 6 hours, 1 day and 3 days.
Choosing one hides that card from the active list until that time, then the card returns on its own while the page is open, and on the next load after the time has passed.
This is a Quarterdeck viewing status in `quarterdeck-call-procrastination.json`, beside `FM_QUARTERDECK_STATE_PATH`.
It is never written under `FM_HOME`, never an answer, and never an inbox note.
The **Procrastinated** status lists those cards with the local time each returns, **Bring back now**, and the same menu.
The menu stays on the card pill in every status, including Sent, and in the Procrastinated view.
Extending adds the chosen length to a return time that is still in the future; otherwise it starts from now.
A procrastinated card stays Procrastinated even when it is also sent or queued, until **Bring back now** or the time passes.
The record is keyed by the stable card key, never by the card revision. Just landed does not use this control.
A snapshot revision change, Update now, and a reload keep that return time until it passes or the captain chooses Bring back now.
This tab remembers the return times in sessionStorage under `fm-quarterdeck-call-procrastination.v1`, so a reload shows the same cards as Procrastinated before the server answers, and a failed read retries.
A successful read replaces that memory, so Bring back now and a call Firstmate drops both win.
A call Firstmate drops disappears even when its time has not passed.
The status works on desktop and on a phone.

**`GET /api/bearings/procrastinate`** and **`POST /api/bearings/procrastinate`** are host only (404 through a preview path).
GET returns `{schema:"fm-quarterdeck-call-procrastination.v1", until:{<card key>: <ISO time>}}` after dropping expired times.
Once the call model is `ready` or `stale`, it also drops keys that are no longer open.
POST is same-origin JSON with no query and a body of at most 1 KiB.
The body is exactly `{key, duration}` with duration `3h`, `6h`, `1d` or `3d`, or exactly `{key, clear:true}`.
Anything else is 400.
The served revision must still match (409 `revision`).
An unknown or closed key is 409 `gone`.
A successful post returns the same `{schema, until}` map.
Saving a busy or invalid file is 503.

## Underway and Charted Next

Both read-only sections follow Just landed in the second Overview column. On phones, the existing Overview tab control includes both sections, remembers the selected tab under its existing storage key, and shows one section at a time. Captain's Call and Just landed keep their existing actions and counts.

- `underway[]` projects only snapshot `in_flight` rows, including `home/task` child ids. Each row retains the producer's task-identifying `name` as `title`, run `state`, `doing`, `kind` and repository basename. Underway membership is the producer's observation, not a new Quarterdeck process-incarnation claim. An actively worked captain hold may also appear in Captain's Call.
- `charted[]` projects only snapshot `gates` rows, with `title`, `reason`, `blockedBy`, owner, repository basename and durable `filed` clock. Dated rows sort newest first with stable unknown-date ties; the producer's reserved return-catchup warning stays first. `(main-inventory)` and `(return-catchup)` are action-free repair warnings and do not count as queued work. Explicit `kind: "warning"` is retained if supplied. Quarterdeck does not infer hold placement from prose or reclassify the producer's decision buckets.
- Rows have stable owner-scoped `key`, content `rev`, `type` and `task`. Their content and coverage participate in the model revision, including chat composition, so work-only changes reach the existing live stream. Snapshot clocks alone do not change content revisions.
- The existing bounded selected-home backlog read supplements only an already projected `(main)` gate's missing repository, using `parseBacklogTask` from `firstmate-records.js`. Duplicate ids fail closed. No row, hold reason, status or dispatch eligibility is created from the ledger; other homes remain unread.
- `workCoverage` records whether each source array is available and carries sanitized snapshot work/inventory omission disclosures. Missing arrays remain unavailable; malformed present arrays fail the snapshot. Invalid or duplicate rows are withheld with `invalid-underway` / `invalid-charted` omission counts. Failed refreshes retain the last good rows and show stale evidence, including on freshness-only stream events. Empty messages refer to the current snapshot, never assert fleet-wide clearance.

The installed `fm-bearings-snapshot.sh` owns `in_flight` and `gates`; the bearings board template owns the displayed name/state, gate reason/filed ordering and warning/count distinction. The snapshot does not expose the board's authored `dispatchable` boolean. These Overview sections therefore have no dispatch or answer controls; they add no additional information stream or board execution.

## Just landed

Overview's second column shows the snapshot's `landed` rows as poster cards in the same visual language as Captain's Call.
At the phone one-column breakpoint, the Overview body starts with four tabs, Captain's Call (N), Just landed (N), Underway (N) and Charted Next (N), and shows one section at a time.
Captain's Call N counts every open card, including filtered cards.
Just landed N counts landings whose current rev is not the acknowledged rev.
The Just landed heading shows that same count in the Captain's Call count badge and hides the badge when it is 0, the same way the Overview Captain's Call badge hides when none are waiting.
The phone tab still shows Just landed (0) when none are new, the same way Captain's Call (0) stays visible.
The chosen tab is remembered for that viewer in localStorage under `fm-quarterdeck-overview-tab.v1`.
A desktop width keeps both columns, with the same 22px gap, and does not show the tabs.
The source is the same guarded snapshot.
There is no board builder and no read of another home.
Each row supplies `id`, `what`, `artifact` and `owner`.
The card key is `landed:<id>`.
`what` stays the snapshot text, path-redacted, and is the card's identity.
For a `(main)` landing, the selected home's checked backlog line supplies `backlogTitle`, using the same title split as an unchecked decision title.
An unchecked line does not supply a landed title.
The card shows that title by the Long text rule, and does not invent words the records do not contain.
`url` is an `https` link with no userinfo, at most 2000 characters, shown in full.
A shortened `https://` artifact is completed only by the Long text continuation rule.
The exact text `local main` is a label, not a link.
Other artifact text is path-redacted and is not a URL.
`-` and an empty artifact are not recorded.
`repo` and the landed clock come from the selected home's checked backlog line only when `owner` is `(main)`: `(repo:)` and the newest `(done|merged|reported YYYY-MM-DD)`.
A `(main)` snapshot `landedAt` may also supply that clock, and the newer of the two is kept.
Another home's ledger is never read, so its repository and time stay unknown.
A date-only clock says time unknown.
Duplicate or invalid rows are withheld as omitted kind `invalid-landed`.
A missing `landed` array yields an empty column and does not make Captain's Call unavailable.
Acknowledge is Quarterdeck viewing state in `quarterdeck-landed-acknowledgements.json`, beside `FM_QUARTERDECK_STATE_PATH` and outside `FM_HOME`.
`POST /api/bearings/landed/ack` with exactly `{key}` records the open card's current `rev`.
The card stays hidden while that rev matches.
A later landing with a different rev shows again.
`GET /api/bearings/landed/acks` returns `{schema:"fm-quarterdeck-landed-ack.v1", acks}`.
**Acknowledged (N)** shows the hidden cards and does not clear the record.
Both routes are host only.
A preview gets 404.
Nothing is written under `FM_HOME`.
The model must be `ready` or `stale`, and the key must be a landed card still on that model, or the post is 409.
The body is at most 1 KiB, same-origin JSON, with no query.
The text box is a follow-up, not an answer and not Procrastinate.
Queue, then Send, posts `POST /api/bearings/thread` with `{requestId, key, text}` where `key` is `landed:<task id>`.
Firstmate replies in that thread.
The note says nothing was decided.
There is no Procrastinate control on these cards.
The model rev includes landed cards when any are present.

## Card threads

The one text box opens a thread scoped to one card when no option is selected.
Its stable id is the card key (`decision:<task>`, `merge:<task>`, `chat:<16 hex>`, `landed:<task>`).
There is no model call: Quarterdeck relays the captain's note and joins existing records; Firstmate answers.

- **Asking** (`public/bearings-answer-form.js` sends; `public/bearings-thread-panel.js` shows the history): text with no option selected is the thread note.
  Queue, Send and Edit are the same controls as an answer, and typing in the box holds updates.
  A thread note is at most 2000 UTF-8 bytes.
  **Send** posts `POST /api/bearings/thread` with exactly `{requestId, key, text}`.
  `202` clears the draft and returns the card to *compose*.
  It does not use the answer phase *sent*.
  The card becomes Sent on the lifecycle control while that note is pending or only acknowledged, and returns to Active once Firstmate replies.
  The receipt is the history entry, reloaded immediately, with the notice "Question sent to Firstmate; the reply appears here".
  An unconfirmed send (network or `5xx`) shows **Retry send**, which reuses the same request id.
  A `4xx` shows the server's reason and unlocks the box.
  Editing and re-queueing after an attempted send keep that request id.
  History stays collapsed.
  The expand control and the history sit above the one text box.
  The expand control (`[data-call-thread-expand]`) is shown only when the card has two or more entries, because one entry repeats the card.
  Its label reads `Thread · N`, and `Thread · N · K new reply` (or `replies`) while later replies are unread.
  Opening it shows `[data-call-thread-history]` for that card.
  The open choice is remembered for the tab only and is not stored.
  The send notice stays outside the history, so it remains visible when the log is hidden.
  Every present card reads its history on arrival and keeps reading every 15 s while the page is visible and the card is present.
  While open, the exchange is the newest message, plus the one before it when the two sides differ.
  Earlier messages are counted on the card, and **Show N earlier messages** expands the same log to everything loaded; **Show latest only** returns to the exchange.
  That control does not open a composer.
  There is no second composer, no `data-call-draft="thread"`, and no separate Ask control.
  The first read marks replies already loaded as seen, so only later replies count as new.
  Opening the thread, or clicking the history, marks the loaded replies read.
  A polite status announces the new replies.
  Reply counts are tab-local, not a Firstmate acknowledgement.
  Thread history state is memory for the tab.
  The box's draft and an unconfirmed send persist with the answer state (`fm-quarterdeck-call-answer.v1:<key>`, including `path:"thread"`), and reload never resends.
  Threads of cards that leave are forgotten.
- **`POST /api/bearings/thread`** (host only; 404 through a preview path): same-origin JSON with no query, at most 4 KiB, served revision unchanged (409 `revision`). Body exactly `{requestId, key, text}`: a lowercase UUID, a card key, and at most 2000 UTF-8 bytes without control characters other than line breaks. The key must be an open card (409 `gone`); answerable or not does not matter. The process remembers 200 request ids, so a retry resends the identical note even after the card left, and reusing an id for different words is 409. Delivery is `fm-inbox.sh note --request-id quarterdeck-thread:<key>:<requestId>` (the same guarded, idempotent path answers and review notes use; a key that would overflow the 128-character id grammar is replaced by `h-<16 hex>` of it). `202 {state:"accepted", requestId, key, noteId, replay, sentAt}`; unconfirmed is `502 unconfirmed`.
- **Note body:** "Captain asks about <Decision|Merge|Landed> <task> | Chat ask <hash> from Quarterdeck: <question>", then the reply route ("Answer with `bin/fm-inbox.sh reply <this note id>` … or in the main chat naming the task id. This is a question, not an answer; nothing was decided."), then a ```` ```json fm-quarterdeck-thread ```` fence `{schema:"fm-quarterdeck-card-thread.v1", key, type, task?, ask?, question, requestId}` (backticks escaped). It never carries an `fm-bearings-answer` block, so it cannot reach keyed intake or the merge rule. A landed follow-up uses the same route with `type:"landed"` and the landed task id.
- **`GET /api/bearings/thread?key=<card key>`** (host only): `{schema, key, task, entries[], omitted, transcript:{state, windowed}, checkedAt}`, oldest first, at most 80 entries (`omitted` counts older ones). Entries are `{kind, from, at, text, noteId?, state?}`, joined mechanically:
  - `ask`: inbox notes whose request id starts `quarterdeck-thread:` and whose fence names this key (or, without a fence, whose id prefix does), plus any other note carrying a `fm-quarterdeck-thread` fence for this exact key; `state` is waiting, received or replied;
  - `answer`: Captain's Call answer notes (`quarterdeck-call:` ids) whose `fm-bearings-answer` envelope has `channel:"quarterdeck"` and the same type and task (or `chat.<hash>` question);
  - `reply`: Firstmate's `fm-inbox.sh reply` to any of those notes;
  - `chat-ask`: the chat ask behind a chat card, and asks linked into a filed card;
  - `chat`: Firstmate's own text in the primary transcript (the chat-ask sources, newest 4 MiB each, cached until the file changes) that names the card's task id as a whole token. Chat cards have no task id, so only their notes and ask appear (`transcript.state:"not-applicable"`).

  Text is path-redacted and bounded at 16000 characters per entry. The browser shows each entry's full text, and offers Copy (with a visible fallback if clipboard access fails). Each entry shows relative and absolute time. Replies join by note id from the receipts' separate `replies` collection (legacy inline `reply` and string `text` remain supported). Claude and Pi primary transcripts use their own record parsers; thinking and tool results never join. Unknown times sort last in discovery order. Receipts unavailable is `502`; an unreadable transcript is reported as `transcript.state:"unavailable"` rather than hidden. Fleet Chats are unchanged: the thread is an extra, card-scoped view of the same records.
- **Rejected alternatives:** answering in Quarterdeck with a model (Firstmate owns answers); a new Firstmate endpoint or thread store (the inbox already gives ids, replies and receipts); matching transcript prose loosely or by task-name words (whole task-id tokens only, so a thread never shows another task's chat); posting the question as a Fleet Chat message (it would lose the card key and the reply route).

## Chat asks

Optional code enforcement is `scripts/captain-ask-stop-hook.mjs`: the Claude Code primary Stop hook blocks ask lines lacking a `[task:<id>]` naming an existing open captain hold. It is bounded, diagnostic fail-open, and skips corrective Stop retries to avoid loops. It must be explicitly installed from an approved clean pinned revision; [installation/removal](../docs/FIRSTMATE-INTEGRATIONS.md#captain-ask-stop-hook) touches only selected-home Claude settings, never stock Firstmate. This complements mechanical linking/closure, not semantic free-form reply inference.

Firstmate also asks the captain things in chat without filing a captain hold, so the snapshot never sees them. `chat-asks.js` finds these asks mechanically in the primary Firstmate transcript and serves each one as a card in the same model. There is no model call, Quarterdeck never writes under `FM_HOME`, and chat cards do not depend on the snapshot. The [decision record](../docs/CHAT-ASKS.md) covers the sources, the full marker grammar, limits and the rejected alternatives.

- **Detection:** an upper-case `ACTION NEEDED`, `APPROVAL NEEDED` or `DECISION NEEDED` at the start of a line of Firstmate's own text. Leading markdown is allowed. The ask continues until a blank line, and code fences are ignored. Quoted alternatives after "reply", and quoted option labels at the start of an ask/list line, become the card's suggested replies.
- **Sources:** the Claude Code primary session, the in-home `state/.main-session` pointer and the cursor-named main Pi session. They are read incrementally behind a persisted byte cursor, at most 4 MiB per source per scan. A new source is backfilled from its newest 4 MiB, and asks older than 24 h at that point are not resurfaced. Only Firstmate's own text is scanned for asks. Transcript `role=user` entries, human-flagged Claude prompts and `queued_command` attachments are unverified input and never resolve an ask; tools and machine records remain excluded. The 2 MiB whole-record ceiling applies to all records.
- **Cadence:** every `GET /api/bearings` (including `?since`) scans before answering. While a stream is open, a scan runs every 3 s, emitting `model` only when content changed and nothing otherwise (hub `observed` events and the stream heartbeat carry freshness). The interval stops when the last subscriber leaves. An idle scan only stats the sources.
- **Card** `chat:<16 hex>`, keyed by a hash of the record id, part index and marker line: `{key, type:"chat", kind:"action"|"approval"|"decision", marker, summary, replies[], source, transcript:{offset, part}, clock:{label:"Asked", at}, answer, rev}`. `answer.question` is `chat.<16 hex>`, and `answer.options` are the suggested replies (`reply-N`), or explicit lettered lines when a decision ask has no quoted replies, plus freeform text. Chat cards follow the snapshot cards, newest first, at most 100.
- **Filed holds:** `[task:<id>]` anywhere on an ask marker line is a structured link; whole-token id mentions remain compatible. A filed decision also wins when its summary/title/reason or backlog supplements contain a quoted suggested reply with the same normalized words (straight/curly single or double quotes, or backticks), or the entire reason equals the normalized reply. Larger unquoted prose and partial words do not establish a reply link. The existing selected-home 2 MiB ledger read supplies open and resolved hold records (`holds[]`); reasons on checked captain holds and item-scoped `fm-captain-hold` resolution blocks support first-seen stale asks. This evidence never creates filed cards; omitted open ledger holds keep their chat cards visible. Duplicate ids invalidate ledger evidence. The ask appears inside the filed card as `chatAsks[{key, kind, summary, replies, replyHints, clock}]` instead of as a separate card. `replyHints` is set when a quoted reply line continues with a description. Linking is checked again during composition, so a snapshot completing after a chat scan cannot publish duplicate cards even without a stream subscriber.
- **Resolution** (state `<FM_QUARTERDECK_STATE_PATH>.chat-asks.json`, outside `FM_HOME`) happens in any of these ways:
  - a confirmed answer (`202`);
  - `POST /api/bearings/dismiss`;
  - fresh selected-home ledger evidence that every linked hold is answered/released/closed, or a fresh snapshot with no omission disclosures and no contrary open ledger hold without any linked task;
  - a later Firstmate ask repeating the same marker and any normalized suggested reply, even when its explanatory prose changes (identical normalized ask text also supersedes).

  Hold closure records `resolvedBy:"answered"`, `resolutionSource:"data/backlog.md"|"bearings snapshot"`, task ids and recorded resolution modes. Unchecked captain holds override historical resolution prose; stale/omitted snapshots never prove disappearance. Resolved keys are tombstoned and never revived. On upgrading the matching rules, the scanner resets only cursors once and replays the bounded newest 4 MiB window to repair existing open cards; existing open reply extraction is refreshed, while dismissals and answer tombstones are preserved.
- **Model:** `chat:{state, error, open, linked, omitted, behind, sources[{source, backfillOmittedBytes}], resolved[{key,status:"answered",resolvedAt,tasks,source,resolutions}]}` is part of the content revision. `chatCheckedAt` is freshness only. The model `rev` hashes the composed cards, coverage, omissions, chat coverage, and landed cards when any are present.
- **Answers:** these use the same `POST /api/bearings/answer` checks. A chat card needs `chat.state` to be `ready`, not the snapshot. A chosen reply is relayed as the captain's own words (`selection:""`, `note:"<reply>[ - <note>]"`). The envelope has `type:"chat"` and `ask` (marker and text, at most 1 KiB) instead of `task`. The note's human line tells Firstmate that no hold was filed. Quarterdeck resolves the card once the note is accepted.
- **`POST /api/bearings/dismiss`** (host only; 404 through a preview path) is same-origin JSON with no query and a body of at most 1 KiB. The body is exactly `{key, cardRev}` with a `chat:` key (otherwise 400), and the served revision must still match (409 `revision`). It returns `409 gone` when the key is not an open chat card, `409 changed` when the card rev differs, `503 unrecorded` when the state could not be saved, and otherwise `200 {state:"dismissed", key}`. Snapshot cards cannot be dismissed, because Firstmate owns holds.
- **Dismiss UX:** **Review dismissal** opens a local confirmation explaining that nothing is sent to Firstmate; **Cancel** returns focus to Review dismissal. Only **Dismiss this ask** posts the reviewed `{key, cardRev}`. Pending clicks are ignored without disabling or dropping focus. A changed card invalidates the review; an unconfirmed save returns to review with a visible error and no automatic retry. On success, focus returns to the visible Overview tab (desktop or phone) only if it is still in the dismissed card, and any selection of that card is cleared. The ordinary engagement release applies; another engaged card is never forced to update. Unsent drafts remain as copyable stubs. Confirmation state is tab-memory only, pruned when the card leaves; reload never resumes or submits it. The Chat ask chip and double left border distinguish chat asks without relying on color.
- **One-off evaluation:** `node scripts/chat-asks.mjs --home <abs> [--state <abs agent-state.json>] [--write]` prints the open chat cards. It persists nothing unless `--write` is given.

## Validation

```sh
cd prototype
node --test --test-concurrency=2 test/bearings*.test.js test/chat-asks*.test.js
# One isolated synthetic browser; run from a clean committed checkout:
SCREENSHOT_DIR=/absolute/private/proof node scripts/captain-call-live-browser-pass.mjs
# Sequential forced-colors matrix (never a second concurrent browser):
FM_BROWSER_FORCED_COLORS=1 SCREENSHOT_DIR=/absolute/private/forced-proof node scripts/captain-call-live-browser-pass.mjs
```

The full `npm run test:browser` includes this pass. Source-preview CI installs pinned `chrome-devtools-axi@0.1.39` from npm on the runner and attaches its MCP backend to the pass's isolated headless Chrome; it does not skip this pass or change local checks. Local runs require the same installed CLI and its MCP backend (bootstrapped via npm on first use).

Fixtures under `test/fixtures/bearings/` are synthetic `fm-bearings.v1` output; tests that run a snapshot use a temporary home with a fake `bin/fm-bearings-snapshot.sh`. Chat-ask tests write synthetic Claude and Pi transcripts into a temporary home.
The browser pass sends a picked option through `POST /api/bearings/answer` and text with no option through `POST /api/bearings/thread`.
It checks that Just landed sits beside Captain's Call on a desktop width and that a phone shows one Overview tab at a time.
It also sends one landed follow-up and acknowledges one landing.

### Inbox debounce

Quarterdeck saves submitted card answers, card thread notes (including landed follow-ups),
and local review notes to its private outbox beside `FM_QUARTERDECK_STATE_PATH` before
waiting three seconds for nearby submissions. Sustained bursts flush within five seconds.
A combined inbox note contains separately numbered original texts, tagged envelopes,
request IDs and card/task references. Firstmate handles each item; Quarterdeck executes
no decision. One combined note receives one inbox acknowledgement and reply; the reply
should name each item/task and appears on every affected card.

Pending submissions remain visible on cards and in the review queue. **Send** in the
message composer submits its drafts urgently and flushes already saved pending work.
Batch queue sends submit card items concurrently so they share the window. A page close
or reload cannot cancel saved server work; tab storage also keeps uncertain client sends
for an explicit same-ID retry. Unsubmitted drafts still belong to the browser tab.

The home-scoped `*.inbox-*.json` outbox stores sealed membership before calling
`fm-inbox.sh note --request-id`; a lost response, retry, or server restart uses that same
combined identity. Confirmed records remain as deduplication and receipt mappings.
Keep this state owner across restarts. Concurrent gateway writers serialize using an
exclusive adjacent `.lock` file. A crash during a locked write can leave that lock;
submissions fail visibly and retain their pending records until an operator verifies the
writer is stopped and repairs the abandoned lock. Never delete an active writer's lock.
